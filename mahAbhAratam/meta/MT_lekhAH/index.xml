      <description>While the bhArata epic is a central to understanding the rise of the Indian state and the very culture of the Indian people, there are some mysterious issues associated with it which still leave a major gap in understanding this historical period. At its heart the epic represents the expansion of the kuru-pA~nchAla realm over the whole of Northern India, establish a unified administrative and cultural zone. The sequence of events leading to this as painted in the mbh are thus: 1) We have the rise of the bhAratas under their eponymous founder the great conqueror bharata daushyanti who raises this line of the pUru kShatriya clan to prominence and pre-eminent rulers amongst the Indo-Aryans.</description>

      <description>We earlier described the major problem termed the bhArata conundrum, where we notice a silence regarding the pANDavas alone in the vedic textual layers, but they are prominently mentioned in all the later texts of Sanskrit and prakrit literature. The following plausible theories may be cited in this regard:
1) The vedic authors were of the kaurava party and hence purposely omitted references to the pANDus. The main problem with this theory is why do they mention the descendents of the pANDava-s as per the great epic in very positive light.</description>
